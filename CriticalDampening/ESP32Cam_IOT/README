This folder contains the Arduino code for the ESP32 cam and Piezoelectric Doormat.

The folder includes the Base64.h library, this is used to decode the images into an ASCII format to
be sent over HTTP.

This also includes the Google Script file that interprets the encoded images sent to it and directs them to my drive.
