CRITICAL DAMPENING:

Hey, this is a folder of all the code I wrote during my DE4 SIOT roject.

Each sub-folder has its own README file, hopefully this helps make it clear when you are reading through.

The overall aim of this project was to monitor dampness in my new flat and provide
a cheap mitigation strategy. This consisted of a facial recognition Smart Doormat and
a context and data backed TWILIO SMS message that instructed the relevant flatmate to take an
anti damp action.

Hope you enjoy!
