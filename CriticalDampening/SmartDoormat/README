This is the main code for the Smart Doormat actuation. In the python file it
fetches the images and carries out facial recognition on them to identify the flatmate.

ONce identified, it fetches recent data from the ThingSpeak channel, and provides a twilio based
SMS prompt to the relevant flatmate. Helping reduce the damp.

Ive kept the OAuth details private for security reasons.
